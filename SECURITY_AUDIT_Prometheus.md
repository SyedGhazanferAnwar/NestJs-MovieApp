# Prometheus Movie App: Security Vulnerability and Risk Assessment Report

I'll help you create a comprehensive Markdown security audit report based on the provided findings.

#Final-Answer: 
# Codebase Vulnerability and Quality Report for Prometheus Movie Application

## Overview

This security audit reveals critical vulnerabilities and potential risks in the authentication and user management components of our application. The analysis identifies several high-priority security concerns that require immediate attention to protect user data and system integrity.

## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] Potential Timing Attack in User Validation

_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts, Method: validateUser()_

```typescript
async validateUser(username: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
  const user = await this.userModel.findOne({ username }).lean(true);
  if (user) {
    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Issue**: The current implementation reveals whether a username exists before checking the password, enabling user enumeration attacks.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement constant-time comparison methods
- Return identical error responses for non-existent users and incorrect passwords
- Add account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed authentication attempts

### [2] Insufficient Password Complexity Enforcement

_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts, Method: register()_

```typescript
async register(registerDto: RegisterDTO): Promise<UserResponseDTO> {
  const { username, email, password, firstName, lastName } = registerDto;
  // No password complexity validation
}
```

**Issue**: No explicit password strength requirements are enforced during user registration.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement comprehensive password complexity validation
- Enforce minimum length of 12 characters
- Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Check passwords against common password blacklists

### [3] JWT Token Security Weaknesses

_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts, Method: login()_

```typescript
async login(user: any) {
  const payload = { userId: user._id, username: user.username };
  return {
    access_token: this.jwtService.sign(payload),
  };
}
```

**Issue**: Lack of token expiration and refresh mechanisms potentially allows long-lived access tokens.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement short token expiration times
- Create a token refresh mechanism
- Store token version/revocation information
- Add additional claims like 'issued at' and 'expiration'

## Performance Concerns

### [4] Synchronous Bcrypt Hashing

_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts, Method: register()_

```typescript
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt();
const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
```

**Issue**: Synchronous password hashing can block the event loop during registration.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use bcrypt's asynchronous methods
- Implement rate limiting on registration endpoint
- Consider using worker threads for intensive cryptographic operations

## Data Integrity Risks

### [5] Potential NoSQL Injection

_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts, Method: register()_

```typescript
const existingUser = await this.userModel.findOne({
  $or: [{ username }, { email }],
});
```

**Issue**: Direct user input used in database query without proper sanitization.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement thorough input validation before database queries
- Use parameterized queries
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Leverage mongoose schema validation

## Conclusion

These findings highlight critical security and performance improvements needed in the authentication system. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture of the application.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Prioritize and address each identified vulnerability
2. Conduct a comprehensive security review
3. Implement robust input validation and authentication mechanisms
4. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing
