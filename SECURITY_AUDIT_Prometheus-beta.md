# Codebase Vulnerability and Quality Report for Prometheus Backend

## Overview

This security audit identifies critical vulnerabilities and code quality issues in our NestJS TypeScript backend project. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of potential security risks, authentication weaknesses, and code quality anti-patterns that require immediate attention.

## Table of Contents
- [Security Vulnerabilities](#security-vulnerabilities)
- [Authentication Vulnerabilities](#authentication-vulnerabilities)
- [Code Quality Issues](#code-quality-issues)
- [Recommendations](#recommendations)

## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] Static JWT Secret Exposure
_File: src/auth/auth.guard.ts_

```typescript
const payload = await this.jwtService.verifyAsync(token, {
  secret: jwtConstants.secret, // CRITICAL: Hard-coded secret
});
```

**Issue**: Hard-coded JWT secret creates significant security risk by making token forgery easier.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use environment-specific secrets
- Implement dynamic secret generation
- Store secrets in secure environment variables
- Rotate secrets regularly

### [2] Weak Password Hashing
_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts_

```typescript
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt();
const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
```

**Issue**: Basic bcrypt implementation may not provide cryptographically robust protection.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use recommended salt rounds (minimum 12)
- Implement adaptive hashing with configurable work factor
- Consider using more modern hashing algorithms

## Authentication Vulnerabilities

### [3] Minimal JWT Payload
_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts_

```typescript
const payload = { userId: user._id, username: user.username };
```

**Issue**: Insufficient user identification increases session hijacking risk.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Include additional unique identifiers
- Add token expiration
- Implement refresh token mechanism
- Include role-based claims

### [4] Permissive Authentication Guard
_File: src/auth/auth.guard.ts_

```typescript
async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
  // No additional checks beyond basic verification
  return true;
}
```

**Issue**: Lacks robust role-based access control and token validation.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement role validation
- Add additional token claims verification
- Create granular permission checks
- Use decorators for method-level access control

## Code Quality Issues

### [5] Unsafe Error Handling
_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts_

```typescript
throw new HttpException('User already exists', HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
```

**Issue**: Generic error throwing potentially exposes sensitive information.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use generic error messages
- Implement server-side detailed logging
- Create custom error classes
- Avoid revealing system-specific details

### [6] Unsafe User Data Manipulation
_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts_

```typescript
delete user.passwordHash; // Unsafe object mutation
```

**Issue**: Risky object mutation can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use object destructuring
- Implement dedicated DTO mapping
- Create explicit data transformation methods

## Recommendations

1. Implement comprehensive input validation
2. Use environment-specific configuration management
3. Add multi-factor authentication
4. Implement proper logging and monitoring
5. Conduct regular security audits
6. Enable TypeScript's strict mode
7. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Severity Summary
- Critical Issues: 3
- High-Risk Issues: 2
- Moderate Issues: 2
