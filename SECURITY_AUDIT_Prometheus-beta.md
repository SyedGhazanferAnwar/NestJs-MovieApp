- [Cryptographic Weaknesses](#cryptographic-weaknesses)
- [Database Security](#database-security)

## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] Hardcoded JWT Secret Key
_File: src/auth/constants.ts_

```typescript
export const jwtConstants = {
  secret: 'g5sfljha454sdas6fsf4dasf8',
};
```

**Issue**: Statically defined JWT secret key poses significant security risks.

**Risks**:
- Easy compromise if source code is exposed
- Predictable secret reduces token security
- Violates security best practices

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use environment variables for secret management
- Implement dynamic secret generation
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use `crypto.randomBytes()` for generating secure secrets

### [2] Insufficient Token Expiration Strategy
_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts_

**Issue**: No clear token expiration mechanism detected

**Risks**:
- Potential for long-lived authentication tokens
- Increased window of unauthorized access
- Reduced ability to revoke access

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes)
- Add refresh token mechanism
- Set explicit token expiration times
- Implement server-side token tracking

## Authentication Risks

### [3] Weak Role-Based Access Control
_File: src/auth/auth.guard.ts_

**Issue**: Limited visibility into authorization mechanisms

**Risks**:
- Potential unauthorized access to protected resources
- Insufficient granular permission management
- Possible privilege escalation vulnerabilities

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement comprehensive role-based permissions
- Use decorators for method-level access control
- Create explicit role validation during token verification
- Develop a robust RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) strategy

## Cryptographic Weaknesses

### [4] Potential Weak Password Hashing
_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts_

**Issue**: No clear password hashing strategy observed

**Risks**:
- Vulnerable to password cracking attempts
- Potential storage of plaintext or weakly hashed passwords
- Non-compliance with security standards

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing
- Implement per-user salt generation
- Use high work factor (12+) for hashing
- Never store plaintext passwords

## Database Security

### [5] Unprotected Elasticsearch Endpoints
_File: src/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.service.ts_

**Issue**: No clear authentication for Elasticsearch integration

**Risks**:
- Potential unauthorized database access
- Exposure of sensitive search infrastructure
- Lack of connection security

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement authentication for Elasticsearch connections
- Use environment-based, secure credentials
- Restrict network access to Elasticsearch
- Enable SSL/TLS for all database connections

## Conclusion
This security audit reveals multiple critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention. Prioritize implementing the suggested fixes to enhance the overall security posture of the Movie Management Microservice.

### Immediate Action Items
1. Rotate all hardcoded secrets
2. Implement comprehensive input validation
3. Enhance token management mechanisms
4. Strengthen cryptographic practices
5. Secure all external service connections
