- [Recommended Actions](#recommended-actions)

## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] Hardcoded JWT Secret
_File: src/auth/constants.ts_

```typescript
const JWT_SECRET = 'g5sfljha454sdas6fsf4dasf8';
```

**Issue**: Hardcoded secret key with significant security risks
- Potential token forgery
- Secret exposure vulnerability
- Lack of secret rotation mechanism

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use environment variables for secret management
- Implement secure secret rotation
- Never hardcode sensitive credentials
- Use a robust secret management service

### [2] Weak Authentication Mechanism
_File: src/auth/auth.guard.ts_

```typescript
// Potential weak token validation logic
canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
  const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
  const token = request.headers.authorization;
  // Insufficient validation
}
```

**Issue**: Authentication guard with potential vulnerabilities
- Insufficient token validation
- Potential session hijacking risks
- Lack of comprehensive token verification

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement robust token validation
- Add token expiration checks
- Use cryptographically secure token verification
- Implement multi-factor authentication mechanisms

### [3] Insecure Password Management
_File: src/auth/auth.service.ts_

```typescript
async registerUser(createUserDto: RegisterDto) {
  // Potential plain-text password storage
  const user = new this.userModel(createUserDto);
  return user.save();
}
```

**Issue**: Inadequate password security practices
- No visible password hashing
- Potential plain-text password storage
- Lack of password complexity enforcement

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing
- Implement password complexity requirements
- Add salt and pepper to password storage
- Use secure password hashing libraries

## Code Quality Issues

### [1] Complex Dependency Injection
_Files: auth.service.ts, auth.controller.ts_

**Issue**: Overly complex constructor dependencies
- Tight coupling between services
- Reduced code maintainability
- Complex initialization logic

**Suggested Fix**:
- Use modular dependency injection
- Implement clear service boundaries
- Consider dependency injection factories
- Use interface-based dependency management

### [2] Inconsistent Error Handling
_Files: auth.service.ts, movies.service.ts_

**Issue**: Unpredictable error management
- Inconsistent error response structures
- Lack of centralized error handling
- Potential information leakage

**Suggested Fix**:
- Create a centralized error handling mechanism
- Implement standardized error response DTOs
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Use global exception filters

## Configuration Risks

### [1] Environment Configuration Vulnerabilities
_File: .env.example_

**Issue**: Incomplete and potentially insecure environment configuration
- Incomplete environment variable definitions
- Risk of secret exposure
- Lack of runtime environment validation

**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement strict .env validation
- Add runtime environment checks
- Never commit actual secrets
- Use secret management services

## Recommended Actions

1. üîí Implement secure secret management
2. üõ°Ô∏è Enhance authentication mechanisms
3. üîê Add comprehensive input validation
4. üìù Implement robust error handling
5. üß© Refactor dependency injection strategies

## Severity Summary
- **High Risk**: JWT Secret Management
- **Medium Risk**: Authentication Mechanisms
- **Low Risk**: Code Structure and Dependency Management
